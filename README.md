heart disease prediction unified
Project Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning models based on patient health data. The dataset contains various medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate. The models used include:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost Classifier

The goal is to analyze the dataset, perform data preprocessing, train models, and evaluate their performance to determine the best approach for heart disease prediction.

Dataset

The dataset contains patient health records with the following features:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)

cp: Chest pain type

trestbps: Resting blood pressure

chol: Serum cholesterol level

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise

target: 1 = Presence of heart disease, 0 = No heart disease

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Replaced non-numeric values

Normalized data using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions using histograms and box plots

Created a correlation heatmap to identify important relationships

Model Training & Evaluation

Split dataset into 70% training and 30% testing

Trained five models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices
Model Performance
